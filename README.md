# lyrics-spam intro

Cutting lyrics into words and spamming them in your friends group chat

This code will cut up lyrics you put in a file and will output them as keyboard inputs.
Simply said, it will send lyrics word for word.

## PREPARATION ##

Before you start the program you'll need to know a couple of things.

The code is written in Python 3.8.2

1. For running the program you'll need to install the ```pyautogui``` library using the pip installer.
***THIS IS NECESSARY FOR THE CODE TO WORK***

2. Find some text that you want to spam and paste it into the ```LyricsHere.txt``` file and save it.

After that you're all set to run the program.

## RUNNING ##

Once you've completed the steps you can run the program, and enjoy! :)

## STOPPING ##

For now, there is no implemented way to stop the program. 
I'm trying to figure out how to stop the program without shutting down the whole script

## WARNINGS ##

**WARNING: You'll have _5 seconds_ after starting the program before the spamming starts.**
**WARNING: _DO THIS AT YOUR OWN RISK! I'M NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR THE ABUSE YOU CAUSE WITH THIS CODE_**

Everything is explained in detail in the ```LICENCE``` file.
